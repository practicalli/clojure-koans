# Clojure Koans (for Lighttable and other IDEs)

The Clojure Koans are a fun and easy way to get started with Clojure - no
experience assumed or required.  The Koans are incomplete lines of code where you have to fill in the missing expression to make the test pass.

The Clojure Koans are organised by different aspects of the Clojure language.

In this version of the Koans, I have removed the _mediations_ so you can simply load the project up into **Lighttable** and use the **Instareple** to help you evaluate the code.



### Getting Started

  Run the latest version of [Lighttable](http://lighttable.com).

  Clone this project to your computer using a Git client, eg:

    git clone https://github.com/practicalli/lighttable-koans.git

  Load the cloned project directory into Lighttable

  Open one of the source files in the project using the workspace manager of Lighttable, eg `src/koans/01_equalities.clj`

  Start an _Instarepl_ for the project `Ctrl-space Make current editor an Istarepl`

  Lighttable will now resolve all the depenendices for this project and start the interactive Clojure environment, the REPL.  Once the blue Lighttable icon stops spinning, you can start filling in the blanks of the code and seeing if you have correctly completed the code.

### Credits

These exercises were started by [Aaron Bedra](http://github.com/abedra) of
[Relevance, Inc.](http://github.com/relevance) in early 2010, as a learning
tool for newcomers to functional programming. Aaron's macro-fu makes these
koans extremely simple and fun to use, and to improve upon, and without
Relevance's initiative, this project would not exist.

Using the [koans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koan) metaphor as a tool for
learning a programming language started with the
[Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com) by [EdgeCase](http://github.com/edgecase).
